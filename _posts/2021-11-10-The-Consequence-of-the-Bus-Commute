## The Consequences of the Bus Commute 

![crepe](/assets/img/bus.jpg)


The main problem I identified during the brainstorming session we had on Monday was the issue of the buses, especially for students that live farther away from the school and therefore are more influenced by issues with traffic and freetime. Although there are many issues with the buses currently, I would like to highlight the successes that they currently have implemented and that I would want to keep in an improved version. The system of assigned bus routes based on where people live as well as the consistent bus schedules that repeat every school day are both very useful to the student’s ability to use the system productively. The routes based on location helps to streamline the route and prevent going off course and extending the ride time, and the consistency of the schedule allows for students to plan their schedules productively on the assurance of the bus time. However, issues arise in the fact that the bus denies students an appropriate place to achieve any work as well as fails to ensure a consistent timing for arrival to the student’s locations. The issue of the bus being an unsuitable workplace means that students who have longer commutes are unable to complete as much work, and therefore are forced to work later into the night on homework. I observed this with my careful semi-fly on the wall observations as a user in bus crises. My bus often arrives 1-2 hours later than expected, and so I found that many fellow bus riders have worried about their workload after and not being able to get the proper sleep needed to fulfill a proper school life. Additionally, I observed the bus’ inconsistency with timing to be a serious issue in the lives of my fellow bus peers. During these many crisis situations where the bus has arrived hours later than expected, people have missed extra curricular activities or appointments. This happened to me just the other day where I had a dentist appointment scheduled for an hour after my bus arrived and yet I made it there with only 4 minutes to spare. This contributes to the larger idea of facilitating community action because when our users in the community are wasting so much of their time everyday they are unable to extend their focus beyond their own work and onto bettering their own community of Horace Mann. Logically, if given the choice between sleeping that night or helping the community, users will choose more sleep. For this reason, enabling commute time to be more useful in terms of completing schoolwork and time accuracy is essential in order for the community as a whole to participate in any community action at all.
