Find two examples of design – one good and one bad. The examples should be in tech but can be software or something physical in society. 

## GOOD DESIGN: THE TABLE

The table is such a good design because of its stability, versatility, and industrial design. Due to the 4 strategically spaced out legs of the chair, the platform of the table is able to support itself to create an even, stable surface that can support great weights of nearly any type without struggle. It is also used by nearly every human being on earth so it’s very well tested, and is often used in Industrial, home, business and other settings. As a plus, it is easily customizable; coming in all shapes, colors and designs, and if broken is easy to repair with small table stubs coming by the dozen. (I’m not actually sure what they’re called but you can get those little things you stick under the legs to make it even again if they get worn down).

## BAD DESIGN: THE INSECT NET

The insect net, often used to attempt to keep small or large bugs from getting into your house, is a poorly designed device. Not only does it fail to keep insects out, it is also an extreme safety hazard for people who have trouble seeing or just people in general who have very little awareness of where they are going. I myself have walked into this forsaken net several times as a child due to its effort to look as invisible as humanly possible in order to not disrupt your view out your doorway or window. Additionally, the small holes in the net allow insects to come in and out at ease, so the only real thing the net has ever caught is you. To make matters worse, the net is very expensive to replace, requiring you to hire someone to help you every time it happens. To improve this design I would suggest some type of coloration or lining in the actual net that's easily visible, and also implementing a smooth, user-friendly installation protocal.
