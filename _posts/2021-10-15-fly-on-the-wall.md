## My AEIOU Sheet

## Summary 

Although the intellectual planning of the UD Intersectionality Speaker Series is beyond incredible, the technological plan of it could definitely be improved, especially since the major users/organizers are older teachers and/or historians who tend to have a harder time with new technology. Immediately upon joining the Google Meet at 7:30, I noticed that it was already experiencing a delay, and then after a couple minutes of staring at a somewhat helpful screen saying that the meeting was about to begin, I was greeted by a history teacher at the school. The general space of the lecture was of course on google meet, which allows for captions to be enabled for anyone that needs them with a clear CC symbol. However, those captions did not match well with the speaker's voice, often mixing up words and always being about 5 seconds behind the actual discussion. This is an issue for people who use captions as a tool to better understand spoken dialogue because it can confuse them. Another thing I noticed was the rigid transitions between different speakers, which made the discussion seem very strange and hard to follow. Another observation I made was that the audio tended to be very inconsistent between speakers, which creates a disconnect and informality in the lecture. However, the speakers did seem to smoothly understand the concept of muting and unmuting when speaking, and how it was important to speak one at a time which suggests good cues in the programming.


## Analysis 

To analyze what I said above, I would start to think about how I could categorize these observations. I considered that the goal-centered tasks of the spotlight change when speaking to be categorized as “A” because they had the intention of doing something and this is how they did it, I suppose. I think the program did a very good job of handling that because it was quite seamless and didn’t require a lot of additional input from the speakers nor the attendees. I then categorized the website limitations in “E”, which I identified as the lack of formal backgrounds and sound or video quality, the inconsistency of the audio levels, and poor lighting. I thought the most important of those was the inconsistency of the audio levels because it required us, as the watchers, to have to manually adjust our audio everytime someone spoke, which disrupts the fluidity of the experience. For the “I” section, which follows the interactions between people and technology, I sorted the details of the student v.s. The host experience. The student experience was quite smooth in terms of the easy access to the seminar and easy to follow format of the speaker’s videos, but the problems came in with the way the hosts interacted which seemed to be quite difficult -- the fact that it took 5 minutes to launch and the uncomfortable technological distance between the speakers. I put this category in “I”  because it shows how the technology created a barrier between fluid communication. For “O” (specific objects) I included the captions, name tags, and feedback. I did this because they are all elements of the environment that impacted the experience in their own individual ways. I then detailed the user prejudice/experiences in “U” which was the difference between the history teachers, student hosts and teenage attendees.

## Process  

Although I did work with Lynn in the initial stages of the project, I chose to write about what I did on my own during the History Lecture because of the strong relation of the lecture to the central theme of this course. My method was creating a “AEIOU” chart and then jotting down observations throughout the seminar, and then later moving the observations around to be more appropriate to their label. I am proud of the way that I organized myself in this project and can’t think of many ways I could improve my work other than having taken more detailed photographs during the lecture itself to highlight the issues I described in my writing. This experience was very eye-opening because it forced me to notice a lot more about the technology I take for granted everyday.
